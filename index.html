                        So, What is a Fusion Fighter?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Fusion Fighters are high-tech androids created by NexTech that people can use
                        to battle from all over the world. In the old days, people put together pieces
                        of scrap metal to create robots, but with modern technology, the sport has
                        evolved into something that anyone (with enough money) can participate in.
                        People all over the world use Fusion Fighters to battle for sport, for money,
                        or both! As someone new to the art of Fusion Fighting, you will need to create
                        your own Fusion Fighter by getting one from NexTech and customizing to your
                        heart's content!
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>
                        Customizing?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes! You can customize your Fusion Fighters. In fact, that the entire purpose!
                        Unlike traditional fighting games, <i>Fusion Fighters</i> is focused around the
                        concept of creating fighters by customizing your appearance, moves, and more.
                        You will unlock more items to customize with over time, allowing for more and
                        more combinations and interactions! Modify your character's outfit, their moves,
                        ultimates, and even special badges that grant passive or active bonuses. Mix and
                        match, and find your favorite combination and use it to beat your opponents!
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        But Where Will We Fight?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm glad you asked! There are a variety of places you can fight your rivals,
                        ranging from cluttered alleyways riddled with hazards to grand arenas, owned by
                        yours truly, filled with spectacle and amazement! Beware, as certain stages have
                        tricks up their sleeve that you can either turn off, or leave on and use to your
                        advantage to mix things up!
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>
                        Is That All?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Of course not! We haven't even talked about singleplayer modes, rulesets, custom
                        stages, items, sharing things online, and wayyyy more. However, I've ran out of
                        time, so you'll have to experience those things yourself! (or go to the page that
                        describes everything in more detail on this website...)
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        That Sounds Great and All, But How Do I Play?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Of course, I almost forgot! You can wishlist <i>Fusion Fighters</i> on Steam to
                        be notified when it releases, and in the meantime, take part of our beta program
                        by downloading the .ZIP file below! While limited, it still has some online and
                        local capabilities, as well as singleplayer modes. Join our Discord server as well
                        to give feedback and play with other awesome people! Anyways, I'll stop talking
                        and let you play. See you soon!

                    <h2>Meet H1-R0 and LU-C</h2>
                    <p>
                        H1-R0 and LU-C are the newest model of Fusion Fighters created by NexTech. These models are the most customizable yet, allowing their owners to customize their moves, badges, outfits, and way more.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Outfits</h2>
                    <p>
                        Customizing your Fusion Fighter's outfits will modify their stats. This will change a number of factors from their speed to their weight, which will impact how they play.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Moves</h2>
                    <p>
                        Customizing your Fusion Fighter's moves will give them different actions they can perform. You can bind any move to any direction on the L-stick plus either A or B on the gamepad. Moves bound to A will be chargeable, which moves bound to B will be fusable... Whatever that means...
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Badges</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can give your Fusion Fighter up to 3 unique badges which grant passive and active abilities. For example, the Burst Badge allows you to perform a burst by using up some of your energy meter, and the Hover Badge allows you to slowly descend by holding the jump button in mid-air.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Ultimates</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a variety of Ultimates to choose from for your fighter. Each one can only be used once your energy meter is fully charged, but has a massive effect. Some will heal you, some will grant buffs, and some just deal damage. Create your build around your Ultimate for the best strategies!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Engaging Stages!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fight with your friends on a variety of stages. Each one with its own special perks that make it unique. These are toggleable, of course, in case you and a buddy just want the vibe of the stage without the complications.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Custom Stages</h2>
                    <p>
                        Just like you can create custom fighters, you can also create custom stages! You can use the tile editor to lay out a variety of tiles to create the stage layout of your dreams! But that's not all...
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Gizmos</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gizmos are special interactable things you can place in stages, these range from teleporters to bounce pads to item boxes and much, much more. Create whatever stage your heart desires!
